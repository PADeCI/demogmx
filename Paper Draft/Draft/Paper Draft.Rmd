  # For running headers, if needed
  short:     "\\pkg{demogmx}: A Mexican demographic Package"
abstract: >
  With information from CONAPO and INEGI  we made a new package that brings data 
  about births, migration, population, deaths and aging rate for each mexican 
  state as well as for the entire country.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic LaTeX that you need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

In general, don't use Markdown, but use the more precise LaTeX commands instead:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}

One exception is inline code, which can be written inside a pair of backticks (i.e., using the Markdown syntax).

If you want to use LaTeX commands in headers, you need to provide a `short-title` attribute. You can also provide a custom identifier if necessary. See the header of Section \ref{r-code} for example.

# \proglang{R} code {short-title="R code" #r-code}

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```

## Features specific to \pkg{rticles} {short-title="Features specific to rticles"}

* Adding short titles to section headers is a feature specific to \pkg{rticles} (implemented via a Pandoc Lua filter). This feature is currently not supported by Pandoc and we will update this template if [it is officially supported in the future](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4409).
* Using the `\AND` syntax in the `author` field to add authors on a new line. This is a specific to the `rticles::jss_article` format.

\begin{split}
\frac{dP_{1, j}}{dt} & = b_{j}(t) - \left(d_{1, j}(t)+ \eta_{1, j}(t) + \theta_{1, j}(t) + \mu_{1, j}(t) + \mu_{1, j}^{H}(t)\right) P_{1, j} \\

where $P_{i, j}$ is the population in age group $i$ and sex group $j$, where $DOC_{i, j}$ is the number of deaths from other causes in age group $i$ and sex group $j$, $DH_{i, j}$ is the number of homicides in age group $i$ and sex group $j$, $d_{i, j}(t)$ is the rate of aging from age group $i$ to age group $i+1$, $\mu_{i, j}(t)$ is the background mortality for age group $i$ and sex group $j$ in year $t$ and $\mu_{i, j}^{H}(t)$ is the homicide rate for age group $i$ and sex group $j$ in year $t$, $\eta_{i, j}$ represents migration rate for age group $i$ and sex group $j$, while $\theta_{i, j}$ is the immigration rate for age group $i$ and sex group $j$.



$$\frac{dP_{1, j}}{dt} = births_j + (immigration - emmigration - aging_{i, j} -  background\ mort)P_{1,j}$$

$$\frac{dP_{i, j}}{dt} = (aging_{i-1, j})P_{(i-1), j} + (immigration - emmigration - aging_{i,j} - background\ mort)P_{i,j}$$
